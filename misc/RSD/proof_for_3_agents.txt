RSD characterization for n=3 agents
(automatically generated proof).

We prove that that the Random Serial Dictatorship is the only mechanism satisfying
  -- Symmetry (Anonymity + Neutrality);
  -- SD-Strategy-Proofness;
  -- Ex-Post Pareto Optimality.

Some nuances:
  -- Symmetry allows us to fix the preference of the first agent and hence to reduce the number of profiles to consider.
  -- SD-Strategy-Proofness is equivalent to the combination of 3 properties under the swap of the two adjancent objects in agent's ranking:
a) upper-invariance  b) lower invariance c) swap monotonicity.
We don't use swap monotonicity in the proof.
  -- Instead of Ex-Post Pareto Optimality we use a slightly weaker property.
Namely, if an agent does not receive a certain object in any Pareto-optimal allocation, then the mechanism must never allocate this object to this agent.

Let's start!

Consider the profile

Note that we have also applied Neutrality to rename the objects to keep the preferences of the first agent unchanged.
